The other exercises are not enough for you? Great, keep going!
This directory contains additional exercises to continue your Python journey and will be updated regularly.

Since programming is something you need to practice, find a project to work on.
This can be anything related to your personal life or hobbies. Python is great for automating things.
Can't think of anything to do? Don't worry, here are a few ideas:
* A program to merge or split PDFs
* A web scraping project
* Explore public APIs (e.g., take a look at https://github.com/public-apis-dev/public-apis) for a data science project or building an application
* A program to download videos from Youtube
* A program for travel recommendations based on user input (start heuristics-based and turn it in a machine learning project later on)
* Look for open source projects to contribute to, e.g., https://github.com/theOehrly/Fast-F1
